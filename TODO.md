1. use supabase-js client to make create/update/deletes to postgres
   1. is this really necessary, because we've already written to remote supabase including migrations...
2. use electric sql for realtime sync on different clients
   1. this is the problem because of cors
3. supabase init for local usage to connect supabase locally first and then use remote?
